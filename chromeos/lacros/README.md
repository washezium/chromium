This directory contains the low-level system interfaces that lacros-chrome needs
to function properly. This includes both device interaction (e.g. querying
displays) and system-provided UI components (e.g. file picker).

The closest equivalent on other operating systems would be a client-side library
that provides OS-specific functionality, such as Win32 or Cocoa.
