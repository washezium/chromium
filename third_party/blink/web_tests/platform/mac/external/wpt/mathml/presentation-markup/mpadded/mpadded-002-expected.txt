FAIL Percentage calculation for width, height and depth assert_equals: width expected 50 but got 100
FAIL Different depths assert_approx_equals: depth0 expected 25 +/- 1 but got 125
FAIL Various combinations of height, depth and width. assert_approx_equals: width0 expected 25 +/- 1 but got 100
PASS Preferred width
PASS dynamic attributes (remove)
